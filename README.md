## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Options

### Date Configuration

- Update regularly or use date ranges

### Time Preferences
- **preferred**: High-priority time slots (get ‚≠ê in notifications)
- **acceptable**: Secondary time slots
- **notify_all**: Set to `true` to get notified about any available slot

### Court Preferences  
- **preferred_courts**: List of court numbers [1, 2, 3, etc.]
- **check_all_courts**: Set to `false` to only check preferred courts

### Academy Selection
- **academies_to_check**: `["kotak", "pullela", "sai"]` or `["all"]`

### Notification Settings
- **notify_immediately**: Send notifications as soon as slots are found
- **batch_notifications**: Group multiple slots in one message
- **max_notifications_per_run**: Limit notifications per check cycle

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. No notifications received**
- Verify Telegram bot token and chat ID in repository secrets
- Check that you've sent a message to your bot first
- Look at GitHub Actions logs for errors

**2. Login failures**
- Ensure phone number is correctly formatted (without +91)
- Check if OTP is required (current limitation - needs manual intervention)

**3. GitHub Actions not running**
- Verify Actions are enabled in repository settings
- Check that secrets are properly configured
- Repository must have recent commits (GitHub disables inactive workflows)

**4. Wrong dates being checked**
- Update `config/check_dates.json` with future dates
- Past dates are automatically filtered out

### Advanced Troubleshooting

**Enable verbose logging:**
```bash
python main.py --mode single --verbose
```

**Test individual components:**
```bash
python main.py --mode test
```

**Check logs in GitHub Actions:**
1. Go to Actions tab
2. Click on latest workflow run
3. Expand "Run badminton slot checker" step
4. Review detailed logs

### OTP Handling Limitation

Currently, OTP must be entered manually for first-time login. To work around this:

1. Run the script locally once to establish a session
2. The session cookies will be saved for future runs
3. GitHub Actions will use the established session

*Future enhancement: Automated OTP handling via SMS API or email parsing*

## üìä Monitoring and Analytics

### Check History
- All checks are logged to `data/check_history.json`
- Includes success/failure rates, slots found, errors

### Slot Data
- Latest slots saved to `data/latest_slots.json`  
- Historical data for analysis

### GitHub Actions Insights
- View run history and success rates
- Download logs and slot data as artifacts
- Weekly summary notifications

## üö® Rate Limiting and Best Practices

The system implements smart rate limiting:
- **2 second delay** between requests
- **5 second delay** between academies  
- **1 second delay** between courts
- **15 minute interval** between full checks

**Important:** 
- Don't reduce delays too much (risk of being blocked)
- Don't run multiple instances simultaneously  
- Respect the booking website's terms of service

## ü§ù Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Areas for improvement:

1. **OTP Automation**: SMS API integration or email parsing
2. **Additional Academies**: Support for other booking systems
3. **Web Dashboard**: Visual interface for configuration
4. **Smart Scheduling**: ML-based optimal check timing
5. **Mobile App**: Native mobile notifications
